RapidMiner Elastic Search Integration
=============================

Rapidminer extension to work with Elastic Search.
Currently working with the official elastic.co offering


### Prerequisite
* Requires Gradle 2.3+ (get it [here](http://gradle.org/installation) or use the Gradle wrapper shipped with this template)

### Getting started
Please note the elastic search is little finicky that the code needs to be build with same version of API as the version of elastic search you are working with.

Goal will be to have atleast two operators read from elastic search and write to elastic search.

5/18 -  Attempted to write data to a hardcoded index, works for now
